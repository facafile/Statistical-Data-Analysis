 data analysis of UFC fights

This project was made by 4 people, including me.
 We wanted to analyse the given UFC fight data and to make some conclusions using that data. 
 We used tools like t-test, ANOVA, logistic regression, linear regression and many more. This was part of a course we took at our college. 
 It was developed in R Studio.
